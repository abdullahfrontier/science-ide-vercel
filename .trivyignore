# Ignore vulnerabilities in system npm installation
# These are part of the base Docker image and not our application dependencies
# CVE-2024-21538: cross-spawn ReDoS vulnerability in system npm
# Not exploitable because:
# - npm is not used at runtime (we run 'node server.js', not npm commands)
# - No user input can reach the vulnerable code path
# - The vulnerability is in /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/, not our app dependencies
# - Our Next.js app uses its own dependencies in /app/node_modules/
